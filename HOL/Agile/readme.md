------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  In this lab, you will learn about the agile planning and portfolio
    management tools and processes provided by Team Foundation Server
    2015 and how they can help you quickly plan, manage, and track work
    across your entire team. You will explore the product backlog,
    sprint backlog, and task boards which can be used to track the flow
    of work during the course of an iteration. We will also take a look
    at how the tools have been enhanced in this release to scale for
    larger teams and organizations.

### Prerequisites

1.  In order to complete this lab you will need the Visual Studio 2015
    virtual machine provided by Microsoft. For more information on
    acquiring and using this virtual machine, please see [this blog
    post](http://aka.ms/almvm).

    **Important note**:

    This lab requires you to use the default state of the virtual
    machine, before any modifications are made to work items or source
    in TFS. If you followed the “Working with the Visual Studio 2015 ALM
    Virtual Machine.docx” instructions you should already have a
    snapshot/checkpoint of the virtual machine before working with it
    for the first time. Apply this snapshot/checkpoint before starting
    this lab.

### About the Fabrikam Fiber Scenario

1.  This set of hands-on-labs uses a fictional company, Fabrikam Fiber,
    as a backdrop to the scenarios you are learning about. Fabrikam
    Fiber provides cable television and related services to the
    United States. They are growing rapidly and have embraced Windows
    Azure to scale their customer-facing web site directly to end-users
    to allow them to self-service tickets and track technicians. They
    also use an on-premises ASP.NET MVC application for their customer
    service representatives to administer customer orders.

    In this set of hands-on labs, you will take part in a number of
    scenarios that involve the development and testing team at
    Fabrikam Fiber. The team, which consists of 8-10 people has decided
    to use Visual Studio application lifecycle management tools to
    manage their source code, run their builds, test their web sites,
    and plan and track the project.
